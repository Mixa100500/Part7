<p>Part 7 of the course covers a few different topics. First, we are introduced to the React router. The React router allows you to split your application into different views that are displayed based on the URL in the browser's address bar. After that, we looked at a few more ways to add CSS styles to React applications. Throughout the course, we used Vite to generate the body of our apps. It's also possible to customize the whle toolchain yourself, and in this part we looked at how to do that using a tool called Webpack. We also looked at hook functions and how to define a custom hook.</p>
